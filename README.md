# Introduction

The Laboratory of Soil Mecanics is one of the laboratories in the Civil Engineering section at the EPFL. The laboratory’s team, under the lead of professor Lyesse Laloui, is focusing on the research in the fields of nuclear waste storage, energy geostructures, bio-improved soil, carbon dioxide storage, behaviour of shales and landslide analysis. 

More about the laboratory activities can be found here: [https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lms/research/]

In 2018 the Laboratory of Soil Mechanics and and Chair “Gaz Naturel” Petrosvibri published a yearly Annual Report gathering the most significant events and achievements, presenting new start-ups, team members and much more. 
The full annual report can be found and downloaded here: [https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lms/annualreports/]

# Project description

The idea of this project is to convert previously printed Annual Report into the digital form and present it in the form of a website using web-development technologies such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The website will be composed in three parts: 
1.	Timeline with the most important events and achievements
2.	International activity of the laboratory with the interactive map created thanks to StoryMapJS
3.	Presentation of the team 

The aim is to render the Annual Report more accessible and give visibility to the research carried out at Laboratory of Soil Mechanics.
